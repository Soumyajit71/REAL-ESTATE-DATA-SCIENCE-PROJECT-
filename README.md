# Real Estate Data Science Application
## Overview
This repository hosts the code and documentation for a comprehensive capstone project focusing on the application of data science techniques within the real estate domain. The project encompasses data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis,
modeling, recommendation systems, and the deployment of a user-friendly application.
## Project Structure
- Data Gathering: Scraping real estate data from various websites including 99acres.
- Data Cleaning and Merging: Preparing the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring consistency before merging.
- Feature Engineering: Introducing new features to enrich the dataset, such as additional room indicators, area specifications, and possession age.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns and relationships within the data through univariate and multivariate analyses.
- Outlier Detection, Missing Value Imputation: Identifying and addressing outliers and missing values using appropriate techniques.
- Feature Selection: Employing various techniques to identify the most impactful variables for modeling.
- Model Selection: Comparing regression models for predicting property prices.
## Model Comparison
The project evaluates various regression models for predicting property prices, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regressor, LASSO Regression,
Ridge Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor.
